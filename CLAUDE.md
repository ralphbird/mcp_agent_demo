# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an advanced load testing and attack simulation system designed to test external currency
conversion services. The system calls an external currency API to perform sophisticated load
testing with DDoS simulation capabilities. It includes:

- **Analytics Service**: Advanced load testing with IP spoofing and burst mode capabilities
- **Attack Simulation Dashboard**: Streamlit web interface for DDoS testing and baseline load
  simulation
- **Ramping Burst Tests**: Gradual load increase in 10 steps for realistic attack patterns
- **IP Spoofing System**: Sophisticated IP address generation from real ISP ranges
- **External Service Integration**: Calls external currency conversion API with authentication
- **Docker Deployment**: Containerized analytics and testing setup

## Development Commands (Docker-First)

### Quick Start

```bash
# First, start the external currency service (from separate repo)
# Then start the analytics service and dashboard:
make              # Show help with available commands (default)
make up           # Start analytics service and dashboard services
make down         # Stop all services
make logs         # View service logs (Ctrl+C to exit)
```

### Docker Workflow

```bash
make rebuild                   # Rebuild containers and restart all services
make clean                     # Clean all Docker resources (images, volumes, containers)
make test                      # Run tests with coverage inside container
make quality                   # Run code quality checks (format, lint, type-check)
```

### Local Development (Alternative)

```bash
poetry install                                    # Install dependencies
# Currency API is deployed from external repository via Docker
poetry run streamlit run dashboard/app.py         # Start dashboard (separate terminal)
```

### Testing Commands

```bash
make test                                         # Full test suite with coverage (Docker)
poetry run pytest tests/ -v --cov=analytics_service --cov=dashboard --cov-report=term-missing
poetry run pytest tests/analytics_service/test_load_generator.py -v  # Run specific test file
poetry run pytest tests/dashboard/ -v                              # Run dashboard tests
poetry run pytest -k "test_convert" -v           # Run tests matching pattern
```

### Code Quality

```bash
make quality                                      # All quality checks (Docker)
poetry run ruff format analytics_service/ dashboard/ tests/  # Format code
poetry run ruff check --fix analytics_service/ dashboard/ tests/        # Lint code
poetry run pyright analytics_service/ dashboard/ tests/            # Type checking
# OpenAPI spec generated by external currency API repository
```

### Key Architectural Patterns

**Configuration Management**: Uses Pydantic Settings with environment-based configuration
and validation. Settings automatically adapt between Docker and local environments.

**Database Layer**: SQLAlchemy with dependency injection pattern. Database sessions are
managed via FastAPI dependencies (`get_db()`). Test isolation uses separate test databases.

**Service Layer**: Business logic separated into dedicated services with clear interfaces
and comprehensive error handling for both currency operations and analytics testing.

**IP Spoofing**: Advanced IP address generation system supporting real ISP ranges from US, EU,
and APAC regions with both residential and datacenter IP pools.

**Burst Mode**: Sophisticated attack simulation with single IP persistence and ramping load patterns.

**Logging**: File-based structured logging for analytics service operations and debugging.

**Testing Strategy**: 280+ tests with database isolation. Each test suite uses separate
test databases in `tests/currency_app/databases/`. Integration tests override database dependencies.

### Database Models

**Key Tables**:

- `conversions`: Currency conversion transactions with full audit trail
- `exchange_rates`: Current exchange rates (10 supported currencies)
- `historical_rates`: Time-series data for 30+ days of rate history

**Important**: USD is the base currency (always 1.0). All rates are relative to USD.

### Docker Architecture

**Multi-stage Build**: Single Dockerfile with separate stages for API, Dashboard, and Analytics Service.
**Service Orchestration**: docker-compose.yml with persistent volumes, health checks, and
**Simplified Architecture**: Analytics service and dashboard services only - no monitoring dependencies.

    └── (future dashboard tests)
```

### Test Database Isolation

Each test file uses its own test database to prevent interference:

```python
# Pattern used in integration tests
test_db_path = test_db_dir / "test_specific_name.db"
test_engine = create_engine(f"sqlite:///{test_db_path}")
```

**Important**: Always clean up database dependency overrides in test teardown to prevent
test pollution between different test suites.

### Load Testing Patterns

Load tests use configurable scenarios and patterns for comprehensive API testing.

## Available Services and URLs

When running with `make up`, these analytics services are available:

- **Attack Simulation Dashboard**: <http://localhost:8501> (Simplified interface for DDoS and
  baseline testing)
- **Analytics Service API**: <http://localhost:8001> (Advanced load testing service with docs at /docs)

**External Service Dependencies**:

- **Currency API**: <http://localhost:8000> (External currency service - must be running separately)

**Note**: The analytics service calls the external currency API running at `localhost:8000`. Ensure the
external currency service is started before running the analytics service.

## External Currency Service Setup

This load testing system requires an external currency conversion API to test against.

**Prerequisites**:

1. Start the external currency service on `localhost:8000`
2. Ensure the currency service is healthy and responding
3. The analytics service will automatically discover and test available endpoints

**Service Communication**:

- Analytics service calls external API at `http://localhost:8000` (or configured endpoint)
- Dashboard displays simplified status from both analytics service and external service responses
- No database or monitoring dependencies - external service handles its own observability

## Advanced Analytics Features

The analytics system provides comprehensive attack simulation and testing capabilities:

### Testing Capabilities

- **Ramping Burst Tests**: Gradual load increase in 10 equal steps over test duration for
  realistic DDoS simulation
- **IP Spoofing System**: Sophisticated IP address generation from real ISP ranges (US, EU, APAC)
- **Burst Mode**: Single IP attack simulation for authentic concentrated DDoS patterns
- **Baseline + Burst Testing**: Concurrent baseline traffic with overlay attack simulation
- **Configurable Load Patterns**: Variable request rates, burst testing, and sustained load
- **Currency Conversion Testing**: Automated testing of currency conversion endpoints
- **Rate Lookup Testing**: Performance testing of exchange rate retrieval
- **Multi-scenario Testing**: Support for different testing scenarios and patterns
- **Error Injection**: Configurable error rates for resilience testing
- **Real-time Status**: Simplified dashboard interface with essential controls only

### Using the Analytics Service

Access the Analytics Service API at <http://localhost:8001> to:

1. **Configure Attack Simulations**: Set up ramping burst tests with IP spoofing via API endpoints
2. **Monitor Progress**: Real-time monitoring of test execution status
3. **View Results**: Comprehensive test reports and performance analytics
4. **Dashboard Control**: Use simplified Streamlit interface at <http://localhost:8501> for easy
   test management

## Configuration and Environment

**Local Development**: Uses PostgreSQL database (or SQLite for testing), default ports
(8000 for API, 8501 for dashboard)
**Docker Deployment**: Includes PostgreSQL service, environment variables override defaults,
services communicate via internal networking (`api:8000` for dashboard to API communication,
`postgres:5432` for database)

**Key Environment Variables**:

- `DATABASE_URL`: Database connection string (PostgreSQL for Docker, SQLite for local testing)
- `API_BASE_URL`: Dashboard API endpoint (defaults to localhost for local, api:8000 for Docker)
- `LOAD_TESTER_LOG_FILE`: File path for analytics service logging
- `JWT_SECRET_KEY`: Secret key for analytics service JWT authentication
- `IP_SPOOFING_ENABLED`: Enable/disable IP address spoofing (default: false)
- `IP_ROTATION_INTERVAL`: Number of requests before rotating IP (default: 5)
- `IP_GEOGRAPHIC_REGIONS`: Comma-separated regions for IP generation (default: "US,EU,APAC")

## Development Best Practices in Codebase

**Type Safety**: Comprehensive type annotations with pyright type checking enabled
**Error Handling**: Custom exceptions (`InvalidCurrencyError`), structured error responses
**Financial Precision**: Uses `Decimal` type with banker's rounding (`ROUND_HALF_EVEN`)
**Request Validation**: Pydantic models validate all inputs with detailed error messages
**Logging**: File-based structured logging with request correlation
**Attack Simulation**: Built-in analytics service with advanced DDoS simulation capabilities

## Pre-commit Hooks

Configured hooks run automatically before each commit:

- **Ruff**: Code formatting and linting (Python files in `currency_app/`, `analytics_service/`,
  `dashboard/`, `tests/`)
- **Pyright**: Type checking (Python files in `currency_app/`, `analytics_service/`, `dashboard/`,
  `tests/`)
- **Markdownlint**: Markdown formatting (all `.md` files)
- **OpenAPI Generation**: Automatically generates `api_specs/openapi.json` when `currency_app/`
  Python files change
- **General**: Trailing whitespace, end-of-file-fixer, YAML/TOML validation

Setup: `pre-commit install` after `poetry install` (one-time)

## Code Style Requirements

- Use lowercase built-in types: `list`, `dict`, `set`, `tuple` (not `List`, `Dict`, etc.)
- Keep line length to 100 characters max
- Use Google-style docstrings for all functions and classes
- No trailing whitespace, files must end with newline
- Follow ruff rules configured in pyproject.toml
- Comprehensive type annotations required

## Important Notes for Development

**Database Sessions**: Always use dependency injection via `get_db()` for database access
**Database**: Production uses PostgreSQL, tests use isolated SQLite databases in `tests/*/databases/`
**Test Isolation**: Each test file uses separate SQLite databases for fast, isolated testing
**Attack Simulation**: Focus on external API testing with advanced DDoS simulation and IP spoofing
**Docker First**: Primary development workflow uses Docker containers with `make` commands
**Financial Data**: Always use `Decimal` types for currency amounts and exchange rates
**PostgreSQL**: Connection pooling configured with 10 base connections, 20 overflow connections
